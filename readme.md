# The New KBIA Pledge Page
Open-sourced for your public media fundraising pleasure.
This project currently consists of an index.html mockup page and the necessary styles linked to it. However, in the future, the dist folder will contain versions to use on popular fundraising software like Allegiance and who knows what else.
## HTML Mockup

The easiest way to preview this new pledge page for supervisors or colleagues is to do it outside the confines of your CRM, so Iâ€™ve provided an HTML mockup that uses its own elements instead of query driven ones.
